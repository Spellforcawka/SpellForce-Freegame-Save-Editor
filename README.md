# SpellForce Freegame Save Editor
Editor for save files for Free Game mode of the game "SpellForce: The Order of Dawn"
Currently, there is no support for campaign save files, hence the name.

Usage: Select your save file with "Open save file...", modify it as you like, click "Validate Avatar" to make sure the game will load it, make optional corrections and click "Write to save file!". The original file will be automatically backed up.

Remember to have the desired ability school at appropriate level before adding sub-schools, eg:
- Slot 0 - Mind Magic - None - 5
- Slot 1 - Mind Magic - Offensive - <=5
